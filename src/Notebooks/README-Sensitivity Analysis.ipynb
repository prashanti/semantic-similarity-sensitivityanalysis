    "# Sensitivity analysis of semantic similarity measures\n",
    "Semantic similarity metrics are often used to compare distantly related biological entities based on their ontological annotations. While semantic similarity measures are widely used, it is unclear as to how sensitive these metrics are to different levels of partial relatedness. In addition to the choice of similarity metrics, there are additional parameters that affect the performance of these measures. Here, we compare a subset of similarity metrics combined with different choices for additional parameters. \n",

    "Annotations in the query profile are replaced, one per iteration, by a randomly selected annotation from the pool thereby decaying the query profile and increasing the imperfection of the match between itself and the database profiles. The query profile is compared to all profiles in the faux database after each annotation replacement and the similarity of the best match is noted. The annotation replacement process ends when all annotations in the profile have been replaced with randomly selected annotations.\n",
